3D training videos
------------------

Drop your 3D training/recording MP4 files here. Recommended filename for the primary training recording:

```
training_video.mp4
```

Notes:
- Keep files out of git if they are large; use an external storage solution and link from the top-level README instead.
- Use the `../show_video.py` helper to preview the video inside a Jupyter notebook or to open it with your OS default player.
